Date: 16-08-2025 - Time: 06:15:22

## 1. Background:
Gradion, a member of the NFQ Group, traces its origins back to 2002 when NFQ Technologies was founded in Kaunas, Lithuania, by four engineers. This initial venture focused on developing code that would power significant e-commerce and travel platforms. The group expanded its global footprint between 2008 and 2015 with the establishment of NFQ Asia in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which served the growing demand for always-on engineering, particularly for high-growth mobility start-ups and large travel platforms.

The evolution towards Gradion involved strategic acquisitions to broaden its service capabilities and geographical reach. In 2022, NFQ Group expanded into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through the acquisition of dlivr.io in Cairo, Egypt, thereby integrating last-mile logistics expertise and a bilingual engineering hub. Further strengthening its advisory services, 2024 saw the acquisition of the German consultancy, ecom consulting, which subsequently formed NFQ Solutions, offering technology audits, digital roadmaps, and transformation governance. The culmination of this strategic growth occurred in 2025, with NFQ Asia and NFQ Solutions rebranding as Gradion, unifying deep-tech engineering, AI delivery, and strategic consulting under a single entity.

Currently, Gradion operates as a digital and deep tech consultancy, emphasising an AI-first approach to assist businesses in scaling and achieving growth. Its comprehensive service portfolio spans business and technology domains, including AI Strategy & Implementation, Tech Advisory & Consulting, Cybersecurity, DevOps & Cloud, AI & Machine Learning, and Audits & Health Checks. Additionally, Gradion provides human capital development services such as Management & Leadership Development and AI Readiness for Leaders. The company caters to diverse industries, including Industrial Solutions & Manufacturing, eCommerce & Fintech, Travel & Mobility, and Emerging Tech Start-ups.

With a global talent pool of over 300 experts directly within Gradion and access to 600+ experts within the wider NFQ Group, Gradion operates across three continents â€“ Asia, DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), and MENA, leveraging a presence in seven countries. The firm boasts robust operational capabilities, including 24/7 follow-the-sun DevOps & SRE, supported by ISO 27001 certified security processes and multilingual support in over 15 languages. Gradion focuses on delivering significant business impact, with its AI-driven systems enabling over $1 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and automating more than 20 million tasks monthly for its clients, many of whom have become unicorns or public companies. The company positions itself on a philosophy of "Paced Like Asia, Delivered Like Germany," signifying both speed and quality in its service delivery.

Satellite Image Analysis Report: GRADION at 77 High Street, #09-11 High Street Plaza, Singapore (179433)

**1. Flood Risk Assessment:**
The property at High Street Plaza is situated in close proximity to a significant body of water, identified as the Singapore River, which is clearly visible flowing along the southern boundary of the immediate vicinity. The building appears to be located directly adjacent to or very near the riverbank. While the general area does not appear to be overtly low-lying compared to the surrounding urban landscape, its direct adjacency to the river presents an inherent risk of fluvial flooding. The urban environment suggests a degree of existing flood defence infrastructure, though this cannot be definitively assessed from the satellite imagery alone.

**2. Building Condition Analysis:**

*   **Roof Condition**:
    The main roof section of High Street Plaza appears to be largely flat and of a light grey or white colour. There are some darker patches and linear features visible, which may indicate different roof sections, slight discolouration, or possibly routine roof features such as skylights or ventilation units. No distinct signs of significant ponding water, extensive patching, or major structural damage (e.g., large holes or collapse) are immediately discernible from this high-altitude perspective. Overall, the roof presents as generally intact, though fine details of material degradation are not observable.

*   **Structural Integrity**:
    From the provided satellite imagery, the building at High Street Plaza appears to be a robust, multi-storey commercial structure. There are no overt visual indicators of external structural damage such as major cracks in facades, leaning, or visible deformation. The building maintains a clear and defined footprint, consistent with its function as a modern urban commercial property. The surrounding area is densely built with other substantial buildings, suggesting a stable and well-developed construction environment.

*   **Site Condition**:
    The immediate surroundings of High Street Plaza appear to be well-maintained and typical of a central business district in a highly developed city. Roads and pathways are clearly delineated and appear in good condition. There is no visible accumulation of significant debris, excessive litter, or unmanaged vegetation that would pose a fire or trip hazard directly on the property or its immediate vicinity. The area benefits from well-kept green spaces and manicured landscaping in adjacent civic areas, contributing to an overall impression of good site management.

**3. Disclaimer:**
This assessment is based strictly on visual information available in the provided satellite images, which may be subject to resolution limitations, atmospheric conditions at the time of imaging, and the angle of view. It does not include an on-site inspection, review of maintenance records, or consideration of factors not discernible from aerial imagery (e.g., internal conditions, subsurface issues, specific flood defence measures, or detailed structural engineering reports). Therefore, this report should be used as a preliminary visual risk indicator and not as a substitute for a comprehensive, professional property survey or a detailed engineering assessment.

## 4. Assumptions:
It is assumed that the LLM correctly identified the property and its boundaries.
