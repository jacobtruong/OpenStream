In 2014, NFQ Lithuania was recognised as the IT company of the year in Central and Eastern Europe. A key milestone in its international expansion occurred in 2015 with the establishment of NFQ Asia in Singapore and its first offices in Vietnam.

The company has since undergone significant global expansion, opening offices in Thailand in 2019, Poland in 2021, and Egypt in 2022. NFQ is currently described as a leading digital and deep-tech consultancy, employing over 800 professionals across four continents, with 36% of its workforce comprising women. It has consistently been recognised as one of Vietnam's best IT companies by ITviec for six consecutive years from 2019 to 2024, demonstrating its strong regional presence and operational excellence.

**Satellite Image Analysis Report: NFQ at 77 High Street, #09-11 High Street Plaza, Singapore (179433)**

This report provides a visual risk assessment based strictly on the provided satellite imagery of the property located at 77 High Street, #09-11 High Street Plaza, Singapore (179433).

**1. Flood Risk Assessment:**
The property, High Street Plaza, is situated in close proximity to the Singapore River, which is clearly visible flowing adjacent to the building complex. The river appears to be at ground level relative to the surrounding urban landscape. While the precise elevation of the property relative to the river's highest flood levels is not discernible from the image, the immediate vicinity does not appear to be significantly elevated above the riverbanks. The area generally presents as low-lying, characteristic of a riverine urban environment in a relatively flat city centre. This close proximity to a major water body suggests a potential for flood risk, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall or high tides, although no direct signs of recent flooding or extensive flood defences (beyond standard river walls) are visible.

**2. Building Condition Analysis:**

*   **Roof Condition**: The roof of High Street Plaza appears to be predominantly flat and constructed with grey-coloured materials. From the available resolution, there are no overt signs of widespread discolouration, significant patching, or visible ponding water that would indicate poor drainage. No large accumulations of debris are discernible. The roof generally appears to be in a fair to good condition from this aerial perspective, suggesting reasonable maintenance.
*   **Structural Integrity**: The overall structural integrity of the building appears sound. The building maintains its distinct rectangular footprint and shape without any visible signs of collapse, significant leaning, or large-scale external damage such as major cracks or fa√ßade disrepair. The multiple levels and sections of the building appear to be uniformly aligned and intact. Due to the high-level aerial view, intricate details of exterior walls or specific structural components are not discernible.
*   **Site Condition**: The surrounding site condition is indicative of a well-maintained urban environment. Roads, pavements, and pedestrian walkways are clearly defined and appear to be in good order. There is managed vegetation, including trees and planted areas, which appear neat and well-cared for, without signs of overgrowth or unmaintained areas directly adjacent to the property. No significant debris, rubbish accumulation, or other obvious hazards are visible within the immediate vicinity of High Street Plaza. The general impression is one of a clean, organised, and regularly maintained commercial district.

**3. Disclaimer:**
This assessment is based solely on the visual information available in the provided satellite imagery and does not account for sub-surface conditions, internal building conditions, historical data, or other non-visible factors that may influence risk. An on-site inspection would be required for a comprehensive risk evaluation.
