Date: 16-08-2025 - Time: 05:31:21

## 1. Background:
Gradion is a digital and deep technology consultancy specialising in providing AI-first engineering, strategic consulting, and technology advisory services. The company's origins trace back to 2002 when NFQ Technologies was launched by four engineers in Kaunas, Lithuania, initially focusing on powering e-commerce solutions. Over the following years, the group expanded its footprint significantly, establishing NFQ Asia in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between 2008 and 2015 to cater to global engineering demand. Further expansion into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region occurred in 2022 with the acquisition of dlivr.io in Cairo, adding expertise in last-mile logistics. In 2024, the German advisory boutique ecom consulting was acquired, forming NFQ Solutions, which augmented the group's capabilities in technology audits and digital transformation governance. The culmination of this strategic growth and integration led to the formal establishment of Gradion in 2025, unifying NFQ Asia and NFQ Solutions under a single brand within the broader NFQ Group.

As Gradion, the company now offers a comprehensive suite of services aimed at scaling businesses through deep-tech expertise and artificial intelligence. Its core offerings include AI Strategy & Implementation, Tech Advisory & Consulting, Cybersecurity, DevOps & Cloud solutions, and AI & Machine Learning development. Beyond technology, Gradion also provides Management & Leadership Development and AI Readiness training for leaders, underscoring its holistic approach to organisational transformation. The consultancy serves a diverse range of industries, including Industrial Solutions & Manufacturing, eCommerce & Fintech, Travel & Mobility, and Emerging Tech Startups. Gradion operates with an "AI-first" ethos, integrating intelligence, both human and artificial, into every decision and system, whilst maintaining a strong commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles by supporting initiatives and ensuring ethical leadership.

Gradion's operations span three continents, with a significant presence across Asia, the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), and the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Leveraging its position as a member of the NFQ Group, Gradion benefits from a talent pool exceeding 300 experts who provide around-the-clock "follow-the-sun" DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) services. The company adheres to ISO 27001 certified security processes, ensuring robust data protection. It supports over 15 languages, including Arabic and Mandarin, facilitating broad international client engagement. Annually, Gradion's systems are reported to enable over USD 1 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) through AI-driven solutions and automate more than 20 million tasks monthly. This operational model, described as "Paced Like Asia, Delivered Like Germany," combines rapid response and adaptability with high-quality delivery, positioning Gradion as a strategic partner for businesses seeking to achieve significant scale and impact.

Title: Satellite Image Analysis Report: GRADION at 77 High Street, #09-11 High Street Plaza, Singapore (179433)

1.  **Flood Risk Assessment:**
    The property, High Street Plaza, is situated in direct proximity to a significant body of water, the Singapore River, which borders its western side. The building appears to be located in a relatively low-lying area, characteristic of urban developments adjacent to a river mouth. While no immediate signs of flood defence infrastructure (e.g., elevated berms directly surrounding the building's river frontage) are explicitly visible from this angle, the close proximity to the river suggests an inherent, elevated flood risk from potential riverine overflow or tidal surges, especially during periods of heavy rainfall or high tides.

2.  **Building Condition Analysis:**
    *   **Roof Condition**: The building complex features a combination of roof types, predominantly large, flat, light-coloured roofs, interspersed with some sections of pitched, reddish-brown tiled roofs. The flat roofs exhibit some minor, inconsistent discolouration in areas, which could suggest slight surface variations or minor water retention in isolated spots, but no widespread or significant ponding water is clearly discernible. There is no visible evidence of major patching, large accumulations of debris, or significant structural damage such as holes or missing panels on any of the roof sections. The reddish-brown tiled roofs appear uniform in colour and condition, indicating no apparent widespread tile displacement or substantial wear.
    *   **Structural Integrity**: Based solely on the aerial imagery, the overall structural integrity of the High Street Plaza building appears sound. There are no visible signs of significant external damage such as large cracks, leaning walls, or partial collapses. The building presents as a cohesive and intact structure from this vantage point.
    *   **Site Condition**: The surrounding property and immediate vicinity of High Street Plaza appear to be well-maintained and typical of a dense urban environment. Roads, pavements, and walkways are clearly defined and show no visible signs of significant disrepair or accumulated debris. Landscaped areas within and around the complex feature well-maintained vegetation, with no visible unkempt or overgrown areas that might pose hazards. No significant external hazards such as large construction materials, waste accumulations, or other potential risks are visible on the site.

3.  **Disclaimer:**
    This analysis is strictly based on the visual information available in the provided satellite imagery at the time of capture. It does not account for internal property conditions, subsurface structures, historical data, local planning regulations, or other factors not discernible from aerial views. A comprehensive risk assessment would require on-site inspection, review of maintenance records, and detailed hydrological and structural surveys.
