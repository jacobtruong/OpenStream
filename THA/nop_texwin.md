### c. Findings:
Satellite Image Analysis Report: Texwin at 1501 Goodnight Blvd, Wills Point, TX 75169

1.  **Flood Risk Assessment**:
    Based on the provided satellite imagery, the property at 1501 Goodnight Blvd, Wills Point, TX 75169, does not appear to be in immediate proximity to any significant natural bodies of water such as rivers, large lakes, or coastlines. While there are small, potentially natural depressions with darker vegetation visible in the wider landscape (e.g., to the north-east), these do not seem to pose a direct flood risk to the main commercial property. No obvious large drainage canals are directly adjacent to the site. The property itself appears to be situated on relatively flat terrain, and there is no clear visual indication that it is located in a significantly low-lying area prone to widespread inundation from the visible features.

2.  **Building Condition Analysis**:
    *   **Roof Condition**: The roofs of the primary commercial buildings, which appear to be mainly large industrial or warehouse-type structures, generally present a light-coloured surface, potentially indicative of metal or a reflective membrane material. Some areas exhibit minor variations in colour or slight discolouration, likely due to weathering or dirt accumulation. No widespread or significant signs of ponding water, large-scale patching, or major structural damage (such as visible sagging or large perforations) are evident from this aerial perspective. Minimal debris appears to be present on the visible roof surfaces.
    *   **Structural Integrity**: From the available satellite imagery, the exterior of the main buildings and the numerous storage units within the yard appear to be in a generally sound condition. There are no readily visible signs of significant structural damage such as collapsed sections, major cracks in walls, or overt signs of disrepair that would suggest compromised integrity. The overall layout and appearance of the structures suggest they are functional and maintained for their commercial purpose.
    *   **Site Condition**: The site is a large commercial yard comprising several buildings and a significant open area used for the storage of numerous units (likely sheds or similar products). The yard areas are predominantly unpaved (appearing as gravel or compacted earth), which is typical for this type of industrial operation. This may lead to dust in dry conditions or ruts/mud during wet weather, but does not indicate a general lack of maintenance. The stored inventory appears to be organised in a systematic manner. Surrounding vegetation, particularly to the west and north of the property, includes dense tree lines. Within the immediate commercial boundaries, vegetation appears largely managed, with no substantial areas of unmaintained overgrowth posing a direct hazard to the buildings. Beyond the intended inventory, there is no significant accumulation of miscellaneous debris or waste that would represent a notable hazard.

    This assessment is based solely on the visual information available in the provided satellite imagery. It does not account for subterranean conditions, internal building conditions, recent changes not captured by the imagery, or specific local environmental factors not visible from an aerial perspective.
