Date: 16-08-2025 - Time: 03:24:07

## 1. Background:
OpenStream AI is a technology company specialising in the development and deployment of advanced conversational AI solutions for enterprise clients. The company creates sophisticated multimodal AI Virtual Agents, AI Avatars, and AI Voice Agents, primarily leveraging its proprietary Eva™ platform. While the CEO, Raj Tumuluri, possesses over two decades of experience in related multimodal and mobile technologies, the company's publicly detailed journey and significant industry recognition began in 2020, indicating its emergence as a notable player in the enterprise conversational AI market around this time.

The core of OpenStream AI's operations revolves around its visionary neuro-symbolic engine, which enables natural interaction across various channels and languages, without the complexities of extensive scripting or the risk of AI hallucinations. Its product suite includes the Enterprise Virtual Assistant (Eva), alongside dedicated AI Avatars, AI Virtual Agents, and AI Voice Agents, designed to provide human-like conversation and empathetic interaction. These solutions are applied across critical business functions such as customer service, help desk support, and co-pilots for employee productivity. OpenStream AI specifically targets industries including Banking & Finance, Healthcare, and Insurance, demonstrating a strategic focus on sectors requiring high levels of accuracy, trust, and sophisticated interaction. The company's expertise is underpinned by capabilities in knowledge extraction, advanced dialogue and reasoning, multimodal interaction, and the ability to define and embody brand personality, all within an explainable and transparent AI framework.

OpenStream AI has achieved significant milestones and garnered substantial industry recognition since 2020. Notably, the company has been consistently recognised as "The Only Visionary" in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Conversational AI platforms for two consecutive years (2022 and 2023). Further accolades include the Intellyx Digital Innovator Award in 2022, being named to the KMWorld 100 Companies that Matter in Knowledge Management list multiple times, and winning Best Virtual Agent Solution at the 2023 Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards. The company has also secured key patents in 2024 for Multimodal AI-driven Digital Twins of Human Experts and for Multimodal AI Agents capable of planning, reasoning, and explaining their actions, reinforcing its innovative capabilities. Its sustained industry standing and technological leadership are further underscored by its continued presence on eWeek's Top AI Companies list and recognition by Aragon Research Globe, with recognitions extending into 2025.

### a. Address: 750 US 202 South Suite 410 Bridgewater, NJ 08807 - City: Bridgewater - State: New Jersey - Country: United States

### c. Findings:
Satellite Image Analysis Report: OpenStream AI at 750 US 202 South Suite 410 Bridgewater, NJ 08807

1.  **Flood Risk Assessment:**
    The property is located within a large commercial complex. While no major bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, or coastlines are immediately adjacent to the primary structures, there is a significant expanse of undeveloped, green land to the south of the main road (US 202). This area appears to be low-lying and potentially marshy or wetland, indicated by its dense, natural vegetation and general topography relative to the road. The property itself, including the building at 750 US 202 South, appears to be situated on relatively level, elevated ground compared to this undeveloped area, likely benefiting from the infrastructure and grading associated with the commercial development. A culvert or bridge is visible further west along US 202, suggesting the presence of a watercourse or substantial drainage feature in the broader vicinity. However, no immediate flood risk from direct inundation by large water bodies is discernible from this image for the property itself. Potential risk may arise from surface water accumulation during extreme rainfall events, given the extensive paved areas and the proximity to the potentially lower-lying, undeveloped land.

2.  **Building Condition Analysis:**
    *   **Roof Condition**: The roof of the building identified as 750 US 202 South (one of the multi-story office buildings within the cluster) appears to be a light-coloured membrane or gravel surface. It exhibits some minor variations in shading, possibly indicating slight discolouration or differing surface textures, but no extensive areas of heavy staining or significant wear are visible. There are numerous rooftop mechanical units and vents, which are common for commercial properties. No obvious signs of large-scale patching, ponding water, or significant debris accumulation are evident on the roof surface from this satellite perspective. The overall condition appears to be consistent with a well-maintained commercial roof.
    *   **Structural Integrity**: From the provided overhead view, the building appears structurally sound. Its footprint is regular and uniform, with no visible indications of leaning, severe cracking, or major structural deformation. The exterior walls are largely obscured or lack sufficient detail for a definitive assessment, but the overall form of the building suggests integrity.
    *   **Site Condition**: The surrounding property is characterised by extensive, well-maintained asphalt car parks with clear demarcation lines. The car parks appear organised and are well-utilised by vehicles. Landscaped areas with trees and grass verges are interspersed throughout the car parks and around the buildings, and these generally appear to be in a good state of maintenance, free from overgrown vegetation or significant debris. No substantial litter or refuse piles are visible across the site. A large solar panel array is situated to the south-east of the office building cluster, which itself appears to be well-organised and maintained. The prevalence of hard surfaces (car parks and roads) could lead to increased surface water runoff, but no immediate drainage issues or standing water are discernible.

3.  **Disclaimer:**
    This report is based solely on the visual information available in the provided satellite imagery. It does not incorporate any on-site inspections, historical data, local flood plain maps, or engineering assessments. Therefore, this analysis should be considered a preliminary visual assessment and not a definitive or comprehensive risk evaluation. Hidden conditions, structural issues not visible from an overhead perspective, or factors not apparent in satellite imagery (e.g., internal damage, plumbing issues, precise elevation data) are not covered. This report is for informational purposes only and should not be the sole basis for underwriting decisions. Further detailed investigations and professional assessments are recommended.
